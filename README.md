# Laughing-happiness Useless web

This is our first individual assignment in JavaScript, the purpose was to create a useless website of our choice using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Christmas is just around the corner so I decided to create a useles christmas tree. The project includes click, double click, scroll and key press events. Try them out and see what happens.

# Code Review

1. I don't quite understand why `global.css` is outside of your css folder.
2. Scroll listener doesn't work on desktop, is this on purpose? If so, why?
3. Good use of comments throughout your files. Makes it easy to read and understand your code – keep it up!
4. Great job being consistent when naming classes, consts, ids etc.
5. **Minor detail** - If you want your christmas tree to stand still while switching it on/off, make sure all images have same width and height when exporting out of figma.

> **Overall fantastic work! You seem to have a good understanding of the foundamentals of JavaScript. I love the theme of your website! Here's a star! ⭐**
